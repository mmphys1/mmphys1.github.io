_Who are you?_

I’m Marwan. I originally thought to use this website to chart my journey as a physicist, with the goal to get better. But, a lot more soul goes into that than I realised. I want to share that, since maybe it'll help others.

_[Where you from, what you on, and what’s your story?](https://youtu.be/GMAVR4AId1g?t=52)_

I come from the UK, I [work in Germany](https://eleqtron.com/produkt/) as of 2024, and by the books I'm an ion trapper, specialising in ablation loading.

_What's ablation loading about, then?_

Fire a high-energy, nanosecond laser pulse at some metal, and it becomes a gas, shooting off like a bullet. With the right setup, you can catch these 'bullets' with a ion trap. It's actually quite a deep topic.

_What do you load ions for?_

Each ion is a qubit. I’m happy to elaborate, but I think the “What is a qubit?” question has been Googled enough by Young Sheldon-types in quirky bow-ties before.

_Can you tie a bow-tie?_

Yeah. It’s one of many pointless skills I picked up in my [grad studies in Oxford](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ef934523-a21b-40a3-bf9f-b54e49c7649c). You need to wear a bow-tie in the exam.

_I bet you were just bursting to mention you went to Oxford._

Not really, this is just the ‘About’ section of my website so it felt like I should mention it.

_What would you do if you didn’t go there, then?_

I don’t know, I’m just trying to help others out with what I can do.
