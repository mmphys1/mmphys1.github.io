Thanks for stopping by. Have some [nano-flowers made using pulsed laser deposition](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlastec.2024.110673).

I'll be posting about my subject of research: ablation loading, with respect to trapping ions for quantum computers.

Put simply, we need to trap ions if we want to do quantum information processing with them. We can do this by firing a laser pulse at metal, and trapping ions vaporised from it. How can we optimise this? There's a lot we don't currently know about it, there's a lot of unrealised potential there, and so I want to engineer the best possible source of ions for trapped ion quantum computers. I'll talk about how I'll get there.

I'll also post about more important things, like life (I promise I won't be haughty about it). I might have worthwhile things to say, but:

1. On the internet, people have already said a lot. Why add more?
2. What am I saying it for?

I'll paraphrase what I said in my 'about' page: I do physics, this is my job, but there is a human side to it that's left unspoken. Sometimes, I feel jaded with physics, and yet I'm hardly a professor, so maybe I should shine light on it.

If you want to chat with me about ablation loading, about physics, or maybe about related life things (e.g. pluses and minuses of doing a PhD), drop me a message. You can use the email address at the bottom of the page, for example.
